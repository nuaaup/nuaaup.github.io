We are the Northwestern University chapter of the American Association of University Professors (NU AAUP). We advocate for Northwestern faculty by defending academic freedom, demanding meaningful shared governance, and advocating for the economic well-being of the profession. We seek a university that fosters higher education as a common good and models democratic ideals.

We welcome members from all departments and all schools at Northwestern: regardless of title and rank, all those employed primarily in research and/or teaching, including tenure-line faculty, non-tenure eligible faculty, graduate researchers and instructors, postdocs, librarians, archivists, curators, and technicians. Our work is determined by our members and their engagement with our university and higher education writ large.


We are a member of [AAUP-AFT Local 6741](https://www.aaup.org/chapters/aaup-local-6741-aft)
and the [American Federation of Teachers](https://www.aft.org/).

### About AAUP

Founded in 1915, the [American Association of University Professors](https://www.aaup.org/) (AAUP) has advocated for academic freedom and shared governance that prioritizes the voice of faculty for over a century. It defines equitable policies of academic employment and advances professional ethics and teaching standards that foster a just society. AAUP centers meaningful faculty and staff participation in decision-making processes and aims to build worker solidarity across campuses in the United States. It represents academic employees of universities and colleges in labor disputes, contributes research and policy on crucial issues in higher education, and fights for the economic security of the profession through direct advocacy and the creation of chapters. 

### Getting Involved

Northwestern faculty, and anyone at NU primarily conducting research and/or teaching,
can join NU AAUP by joining the [national AAUP organization](https://www.aaup.org/join),
then contacting the chapter at [nu-aaup@proton.me](mailto:nu-aaup@proton.me).
We advise using a non-NU email address for these steps.
Note that faculty discretionary funding can be used to pay AAUP membership dues.
We will add you to our members' email list.

We're in the process of creating a public-facing email list.
If you want to hear about what NU AAUP is doing,
